Two years ago, I first came across Macintosh the system introduced by Apple. At that moment, I fell in love with it for its simplicity and productivity. It is worth mentioning that our office is fully equip with Apple’s computers.

Today I’d like to share some great tools I use daily in my work and in my life.

## 1) Sketch

If you are a designer, you can never miss this tool. <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is vector design tool introduced by Bohemian Coding. In their words,

> Sketch gives you the power, flexibility and speed you always wanted in a lightweight and easy-to-use package. Finally you can focus on what you do best: Design.

Of course, Photoshop and Illustrator are powerful tools. But for UI/UX designers, they provide too much unnecessary functions that are never used. Further more, they are too heavy and not that fast.

Nowadays, more and more designers start switching to Sketch, and the community for it is getting larger. <a href="http://www.teambition.com/" target="_blank">Teambition</a> design team has already use Sketch for several months and they highly praise it.

## 2) Reeder

I have never seen another RSS reader better than <a href="http://reederapp.com/" target="_blank">Reeder</a>. I love it so much. Reeder provides me the perfect reading experience no matter in Mac or iPhone. Every day on my way to office, I read news on the Reeder App. Without Reeder, I may not develop the rabbit to read every morning.

## 3) Writer Pro

I have heard <a href="http://writer.pro/" target="_blank">Writer Pro</a> for a long time, but have started to use it recently because of writing blog. 

> Writer Pro is a professional writing suite that introduces syntax analysis and a simple workflow. 

When using Writer Pro, I feel so smooth to write something. Not only for the simplicity of its UI, but also for the short-cuts provided especially when writing in Markdown. I highly recommend this writing tool to you.

## 4) Dash

A lot of time, you have to check documents when coding. Then you open the browser, type the site url, press Enter button, scan the page and get what you want. But with <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash" target="_blank">Dash</a>, you just need to type the keyword no matter your computer is connected to the Internet.

Dash has integrated with all popular IDEs, and tools like Alfred and Terminal, which make it so convenient to check documents when needed.

## 5) The Omni Group Apps

<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/" target="_blank">The Omni Group</a> has developed a series of great tools, which are focus on efficiency.

**OmniFocus** let you track and review your to-dos.

**OmniGraffle** concentrates on diagramming.

**OmniOutliner** help you write in clear format.

**OmniPlan** is an excellent project management tool.

## 6) JetBrains

Coders are familiar with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a>. They provide us smart IDEs and code editors, like IntelliJ IDEA, AppCode, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine and so on. They nearly cover all the main program languages. 

All of them are powerful, and you may need some time to learn to master it. After you become familiar with one of them, you know them all, and you can never leave them.
