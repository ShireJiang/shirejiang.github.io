Recently I start to learn drawing icons with <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a>, and want to share a good tutorial with you. Above is the final result.

I follow the <a href="https://medium.com/@KounterB/b76271a095e3" target="_blank">tutorial</a> from Medium by Sebastien Gabriel. He is a designer and highly recommends Sketch. If you haven't tried it, you absolutely should.
 
Here I attached the final source file, and you can [download here](/images/2014-06-29/colorful-switch.zip).
