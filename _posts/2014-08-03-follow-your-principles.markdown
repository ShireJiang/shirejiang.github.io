Everyone should have his own principles to make himself closer to success, to make his time more valuable or just to avoid uncomfortable situations.  Today, I’d like to talk about some principles which are valuable to me.

## 1) Love

Love is not for just the girl or the boy you fall in love with, even though that is the most fantastic thing in the world. 

Love is for every person you want to stay with — family members, best friends and of course your sweetheart. These people are most important to you, no matter who you are. 

So, put your heart into them, and spare more time with them. No other things are more valuable than them.

## 2) Trust People

No matter in your life or in your work, there are lots of people to get together. The first thing you should do is to have the basic trust for them. Trust the man you play with and work with, only then you will have fun and work more efficient. 

**Trust people if only they are not worthy it.**

## 3) Develop Hobbits

Develop some hobbits, and your life will become more colorful. 

No one is iron man, and every one can get tired and boring sometime, especially after a period of heavy work. A hobbit can get you rid of that kind of bad feelings, and charge you with new energy. 

**A hobbit can be a restart button for yourself.**

## 4) Value Time

> Never pull till tomorrow what you can do today.

Everyone knows this truth, but it is really hard to follow. But when you raise a habit, you will find that you can arrange your time more reasonable and finish your work more efficient. The most important thing is keep doing it. 

Time is valuable and your energy is limited and you can’t do everything. You should decide what to accept and what to reject. If something is beyond your ability or energy, learn to say **NO**, that will good for yourself and others. Trust me.

## 5) Read

Keep reading everyday. Don’t say you have no time to read or can’t find articles to read. 

Reading is the best way to study, because you are on the shoulder of giants.

## 6) Don’t Be Afraid

Brave man can succeed. If you are afraid of something, you have failed. Failure is no way to scare, because it is the best way to grow, so embrace failure after hard working. There is nothing to shame. 

Follow your ideas, and keep trying. Success is glory and failure is not that bad.

## 7) New Things

Be curious about new things like a child which will open your eyes. 

Study new things will full fill yourself.

Doing new things which will make you different from others.
